                 <p>Elder law is a complicated area of law with conflicting rules, regulations and solutions. There are no “cookie cutter” senior care plans. In fact, what worked for one client situation, will probably not work the same effect for another client. Estate planning documents that may have been appropriate a few years ago, may now have an undesirable effect. Why? Because your circumstances have changed, your needs and objectives have changed, or the law has changed. We will work with you to understand your needs, circumstances, resources, and goals. We will then develop a custom estate plan or senior care plan that accomplishes your goals and addresses your needs. As circumstances change, as the law changes, as your needs change, we will work with you to update and modify your plan to ensure it continues to accomplish what you want it to do.</p>

                 <p>Attorneys generally bill for services on an hourly rate, a percentage or contingency fee basis, or on a flat fee basis. We prefer to utilize a flat fee structure whenever we can as we believe this is in your best interest. Our fee will be based upon the work being performed, the level of expertise required to effectively implement the plan, and the results achieved for you. At your initial consultation, you will know what the total cost will be and you can decide whether or not it makes sense for you. We will rarely be the cheapest attorney but we also rarely be the most expensive. Seniors need to get their plans right the first time, as mistakes may be very costly and not easily correctable. To be honest, you need us to be successful so that we will be around in the future and can continue to work for you and your family. True value doesn’t come in the least expensive plan; it comes in a plan that will work at a fair price. We will demonstrate to you how we can provide value to you in an estate plan or Senior Care Plan we recommend to you. You then can decide whether or not your plan will be valuable enough to you to move forward.</p>
