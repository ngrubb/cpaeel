        <p class="lead">Central PA Estate &amp; Elder Law provides numerous services to help seniors, their families and caregivers get the care they need, qualify for additional help to pay for their care, while safeguarding and protecting their home and as much of their assets as the law allows.</p>

      <!-- How We Help -->
      <div class="featurette">
        <h2 class="featurette-heading">How We Help</h2>
        <p class="lead">We educate, evaluate, strategize, and implement. These four words summarize our methodology in helping our clients achieve their goals. Whether the client or potential client needs a relatively simple task accomplished, such as writing a simple will, or they require more extensive help, the following framework works to show the process of how we help our clients. Read through our process and then continue reading on to see how we have helped others and how we may be able to help you.</p>

        <div class="row">
          <img class="img-polaroid" src="img/howwehelp.jpg">
        </div>

        <p>First, we <strong>educate</strong> our clients on the legal and care related issues seniors face, the potential outcomes and the strategies available to help them. Often, seniors become clients after attending a public educational workshop on estate planning or elder law issues. Sometimes, all the senior knows is they need help. In this case, education begins at the initial consultation and continues throughout our representation.</p>

        <p>Secondly, we meet with seniors and sometimes family members, who are interested in getting help with their legal and care issues. At the initial consultation, we discuss with them their concerns and goals and <strong>evaluate</strong>  their needs, resources, and limitations. At this point, we now have an understanding of their objectives and issues, and what needs to be done to address their concerns. We will demonstrate how we can help them by suggesting an outline of a strategy that will address their needs and meet their objectives. We will discuss with them our cost to fully develop and implement a proposed plan and how it provides worthwhile value to them. Should they choose to go forward, our representation will begin. Should they choose not to go forward at that time, they owe us nothing and we part friends wishing each other well.</p>

        <p>Third, we fully develop the <strong>strategy</strong> outlined at the initial consultation. This stage includes, agreeing upon the extent of services to be provided, the anticipated timeline for implementation and acquiring any additional information that may be needed to implement the  plan. We put your Senior Care Plan into writing for your review and approval. Whether a comprehensive Senior Care Plan or a fairly straight forward estate plan, we will clearly describe to you what we will do, what other professionals or care providers will need to do for you, and what you must to do to fully implement the strategy.</p>

        <p>Finally, we <strong>implement</strong> the plan. For some seniors, such as those facing an imminent crisis, parts of the plan may begin to be implemented immediately following the initial consultation, even before the written plan is completed. For others who are planning ahead, we deliver the written plan for their approval before we begin to implement it. As we implement the plan, if circumstances change, if the law changes, or if your health or family concerns change, then we will adjust the plan accordingly. After the plan is implemented, we will periodically, at agreed upon intervals, review and re-evaluate your plan with you to ensure it is continuing to meet your needs and achieve your objectives.</p>

          <h3>Staying Home as Long as Possible</h3>
            <p>The goal for many seniors is to stay at home, and out of a nursing home, as long as possible. Generally speaking, in-home care is much more desirable and much less expensive then care in a nursing home facility. In fact, wisely spending some additional money now, to ensure your home is a safe environment and hiring appropriate in-home services, can dramatically postpone the time when you may need care in a nursing home facility, if ever. Through a Senior Care Plan, we can help to determine any physical and mental limitations, help determine the appropriate level of care you require on a day-to-day basis, and then locate professional providers to provide in-home care to you. A Senior Care Plan, will provide you with a roadmap to staying at home as long as possible, getting the appropriate in-home care services, and identifying sources to help pay for your care. To understand how a Senior Care Plan can help you stay at home as long as possible, call our office at 1 (800) 497-4103 to speak with an experienced elder law attorney.</p>

          <h3>Qualification for Pennsylvania Medicaid</h3>
            <blockquote>
              <p>We help seniors qualify for Medicaid as soon as is legally permissible while helping them safeguard and protect their home and as much of their assets as the law allows.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Medicaid is the only government program that pays for long-term nursing care needs. Medicaid may be able to provide assistance in paying for your care in a qualified nursing facility or through home and community based programs. Qualification for Medicaid programs is based upon your medical condition, your income and your resources or assets. Many people believe they must be completely impoverished before they can qualify for Medicaid benefits. This is not true. There are a number of assets that are not counted in determining whether or not you qualify for benefits. If you are married, and only one spouse needs nursing care, the healthy spouse is entitled to “spousal impoverishment” protections allowing them to keep sufficient assets for their own needs as well. The Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare (DPW), administers the Medicaid program in Pennsylvania. The rules are complicated and the implementation of the rules by DPW is constantly changing. In addition, after you have passed away, the DPW mandates an Estate Recovery Program to which it expects to be repaid from your estate for the nursing care Medicaid paid for.</p>

            <p>A good Medicaid plan has three parts: 1) quick qualification for benefits; 2) assistance in maintaining those benefits so that nothing is done that would cause you to loose your benefits; and 3) properly structuring your assets so that the effects of the Estate Recovery are minimized. Most citizens see an accountant or tax preparer to help make sure they pay only what they are absolutely required to pay in income taxes – and no more. In the same way, many people seek the services of an elder law attorney to make sure they don’t spend too much on long term care before they apply for Medicaid. To find out how Central PA Estate &amp; Elder Law can help you with a Medicaid plan, call our office at 1 (800) 497-4103 to speak with an experienced elder law attorney.</p>

          <h3>Thoughtful Estate Plans</h3>
          <blockquote>
              <p>We develop custom tailored estate plans that reduce taxes, protect assets, preserve family peace and efficiently carry out the intentions of our clients.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>When we think of estate plans, we think of writing a Last Will or perhaps a Revocable Living Trust Estate plan. A good estate plan will not only address the distribution of your estate after you have passed away, but will also address who will take care of your financial and legal affairs while you are living. Additionally, a good estate plan will address if you become very ill or are incapacitated, and who has access to your private healthcare information and who can make healthcare decisions for you if you can’t make them for yourself. A financial and legal Power of Attorney, a Health Care Power of Attorney, and a Living Will are important documents that should not be overlooked. A good estate plan will also consider ways to streamline the estate settlement process and reduce any PA Inheritance Taxes and Federal Estate Taxes that may apply. Sometimes, because of family concerns, our greatest objective is not to protect our assets for our heirs, but to protect the assets we are passing to our heirs--from our heirs. Our children and grandchildren are not always responsible and often times don’t handle money the same way we do. A well thought out estate plan can implement provisions that pass your assets on to your heirs but with certain protections built in so that your hard earned assets are not   squandered. To explore how a thoughtful estate plan can help you and your loved ones, call our office at 1 (800) 497-4103 to speak with an experienced elder law attorney.</p>

          <h3>Efficient Trust and Estate Administration</h3>
            <p>It is inevitable, we are all going to die. When that time comes, you can be assured that Central PA Estate &amp; Elder Law has the knowledge and experience to ensure your estate or trust is administered efficiently and quickly and at a fair cost.
